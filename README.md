# Phishing-URL-Detection

This project implements phishing URL detection using machine learning models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, stacking, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.9
- Libraries: pandas, sk-learn, numpy

## How to Run

1. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training:**
   - Run the entire code in `phishing_detection.ipynb` to preprocess the data and train the models.

2. **Predictions:**
   - Modify the code in `phishing_detection.ipynb` for making predictions on new data.

## Files Description

- `phishing_detection.py`: Contains the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
- `phishing_train.csv`: Training data file.
- `testing_data.csv`: Test data file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the project
